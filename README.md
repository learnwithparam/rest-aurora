# API design for beginners

RESTful API design workshop for beginners using Node Js and MongoDB

## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2 or greater
- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/) v8 or greater
- [yarn][https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/] v1 or greater (or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v6 or greater)

Note: Install docker desktop, it will include docker engine, compose and other goodies from docker

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - v17 or above
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - v1.2 and above


All of these must be available in your PATH. To verify things are set up properly, you can run this:

```
git --version
node --version
yarn --version # or npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment variable and how to fix it here for [windows](https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/) or [mac/linux](http://stackoverflow.com/a/24322978/971592).
